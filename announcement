New release of Vocola 2, 2.8.8, now available

    Not a lot of notable changes since the last version (2.8.7):

* Attempting to use <_anything> as a command by itself now prints an
  error rather than crashing the compiler.

* Clipboard extension updated to version 2.1, which includes new
  WaitForValue procedure.


    I also made a lot of portability fixes to make Vocola 2 work with
Python 3 and (hopefully) with future NatLink versions that work with
Python 3.  Unfortunately, we still don't have a working installer for
the new version of NatLink so I was unable to make this version of
Vocola work with NatLink on Python 3.  :-(


    This is the last release of the 2.8.X series barring emergency hot
patches.  The next release will be 2.9, hopefully in alpha release in a
month or two.

    This release is probably not of great interest to most folks, but if
you want to upgrade to it, you may install Vocola 2.8.8 over any recent
NatLink for Python 2 installation by downloading
http://vocola.net/v2/Vocola-2-8-8.zip then

    unzip it to a temporary location, say T
    run (e.g., double click) T/install.bat
    (re)start Dragon

New release of Vocola 2, 2.8.7, now available

    Notable changes since last version (2.8.6):

! By default, Vocola now uses SendInput instead of SendDragonKeys to
  send keystrokes.  This should work better in most cases: SendInput is
  immune to the character doubling/dropping bug, for example.
  SendInput, however, does not work with UAC-elevated windows and may
  have issues with some foreign-language keyboard settings.  

  Accordingly, you may now temporarily switch back to SendDragonKeys via
  a voice command, add code in the the DragonProxy extension (see below)
  to further translate keystrokes as needed, or simply delete the
  DragonProxy extension to permanently switch back to using
  SendDragonKeys.  

  More information on the different ways of sending keystrokes may be
  found on the Vocola 2 website at
  http://vocola.net/v2/SendingKeystrokes.asp.

! The following unofficial Vocola extensions have been made official,
  and are now included in the Vocola 2 release:
    Clipboard, Date, Env, Keys, Subprocess, Variable, and Vocola

! Python version 2.6 is no longer supported

* Vocola now supports a _Dragon proxy_, which is a special Vocola
  extension that can intercept and change or redirect Vocola's calls to
  Dragon.  A starter version of the proxy is provided which can switch
  back and forth between SendDragonKeys and SendInput for default
  keystrokes as well as print out Dragon actions when verbose mode is
  turned on.

* Vocola now prints an error if the user redefines an extension function

* A great deal of portability work has been done under the covers to
  make Vocola 2 work with Python 3.  Hopefully the next version will
  support Python 3.

* Vocola 2 is being refactored to be more flexible.  As part of this, it
  is now possible to choose a backend dynamically at "compile time".
  This is intended to be used for "cross-compilation" -- e.g., compiling
  to Dragonfly or Advanced Scripting instead of NatLink directly.
  Currently only NatLink and trivial echo backends are available.

    This will hopefully be the last version that only works with Python
2.  A combined installer that installs NatLink and this version of
Vocola will *not* be available -- the NatLink project is instead
focusing on a new version that works with Python 3.  This plus some
dependencies that have crept in for the installer means that the install
procedure for Vocola is somewhat longer than I would like.  See
http://vocola.net/v2/InstallVocola.asp for the installation
instructions.

New release of Vocola 2, 2.8.6, now available


    Notable changes since last announced version (2.8.5):

! Grammar rules are now [de]activated as infrequently as possible; this
  improves performance with DNS 13/DPI 14, which take a long time to
  deactivate grammars.

* Executables whose names contain underscores are now properly handled.
  For example, a Vocola file named xyz_inc_edit__routines.vcl now
  contains commands that work only with executables named
  xyz_inc_edit__routines, xyz_inc_edit, xyz_inc, and xyz.

* As of DNS 13, <_anything> can no longer match nothing.  Accordingly,
  [<_anything>], [[with] <_anything>], and the like are now permitted.
  These were previously prohibited in an attempt to prohibit optional
  parts whose contents could be empty.

* Fixed an error where include statements were not interpreted relative
  to the file containing them.  For example, "include bar/baz.vch" in
  foo/zeep.vcl now correctly refers to foo/zeep/bar/baz.vch.


    A combined installer that installs NatLink and Vocola 2.8.6 will be
available soon.  In the meantime, you may install Vocola 2.8.6 over any
recent NatLink installation by downloading http://vocola.net/v2/Vocola-2-8-6.zip then

    unzip it to a temporary location, say T
    run (e.g., double click) T/install.bat
    (re)start Dragon
