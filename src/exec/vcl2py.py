# vcl2py:  Convert Vocola voice command files to NatLink Python "grammar"
#          classes implementing those voice commands
#
# Usage: python vcl2py.py [<option>...] <inputFileOrFolder> <outputFolder>
# Where <option> can be:
#   -debug <n>             -- specify debugging level 
#                               (0 = no info, 1 = show statements, 
#                                2 = detailed info)
#   -extensions <filename> -- specify filename containing extension interface 
#                             information
#   -f                     -- force processing even if file(s) not out of date
#   -INI_file <filename>   -- specify filename of INI file to use
#   -log_file <filename>   -- specify filename to log to
#   -log_stdout            -- log to standard out instead of a file
#   -max_commands <n>      -- specify maximum number of commands per utterance
#   -numbers <s0>,<s1>,<s2>,...
#                          -- use spoken form <s0> instead of "0" in ranges,
#                             <s1> instead of "1" in ranges, etc.
#   -q                     -- ignore any INI file
#   -suffix <s>            -- use suffix <s> to distinguish Vocola generated 
#                             files (default is "_vcl")
