New in 2.8.7:

! The following unofficial Vocola extensions have been made official,
  and are now included in the Vocola 2 release:
    Clipboard, Date, Env, Keys, Subprocess,  Variable, and Vocola

* Vocola 2 is being refactored to be more flexible.  As part of this, it
  is now possible to choose a backend dynamically at "compile time".
  This is intended to be used for "cross-compilation" -- e.g., compiling
  to Dragonfly or Advanced Scripting instead of NatLink directly.
  Currently only NatLink and trivial echo backends are available.


New in 2.8.6:

* As of DNS 13, <_anything> can no longer match nothing.  Accordingly,
  [<_anything>], [[with] <_anything>], and the like are now permitted.
  These were previously prohibited in an attempt to prohibit optional
  parts whose contents could be empty.

! Grammar rules are now [de]activated as infrequently as possible; this
  improves performance with DNS 13/DPI 14, which take a long time to
  deactivate grammars.

* Fixed an error where include statements were not interpreted relative
  to the file containing them.  For example, "include bar/baz.vch" in
  foo/zeep.vcl now correctly refers to foo/zeep/bar/baz.vch.

* Executables whose names contain underscores are now properly handled.
  For example, a Vocola file named xyz_inc_edit__routines.vcl now
  contains commands that work only with executables named
  xyz_inc_edit__routines, xyz_inc_edit, xyz_inc, and xyz.


New in 2.8.5:

! Workaround for the doubling/dropping bug: key sequences are now
  preceded by the current-language-appropriate version of {shift};
  doubling or dropping of the initial shift key down event does not
  affect later keystrokes.

! Updating to a different version of Vocola is now much easier; just:
    unzip it to a temporary location, say T
    run (e.g., double click) T/install.bat
    (re)start Dragon
  Updating from source code is similar but you instead run
    R/src/install.bat where R is the Vocola 2 repository root

* New exception, VocolaRuntimeAbort, that Vocola extensions may raise to
  abort the current utterance without error.


New in 2.8.4:

* Versions of Python earlier than 2.6 are no longer supported.

* If the user's command folder C contains a subdirectory matching the
  current language's short name (e.g., enx for English), use that
  subdirectory (e.g., C/enx) as their command folder instead.  This
  allows multilingual users to have separate commands for each language
  they use.


New in 2.8.3:

* Source code converted to git, moved to github at
  https://github.com/mdbridge/Vocola-2

* Removed support for falling back to Simpscrp

* Removed support for using Perl version of Vocola


New in 2.8.2:

* Fixed a bug where one command invoking another in the same grammar
  (typically via HeardWord) caused errors.

* Change to support non-backward-compatible NatLink interface change:
  movement of some names from natlinkutils to natlink

* Fixed handling of numbers option to allow missing numbers (e.g., $set
  numbers "" or $set numbers ",one,,three") and handle leading or
  trailing white space correctly.

* Fixed handling of $set numbers so it applies to only the current
  command file, not all files compiled afterwards.


New in 2.8.1:

! Any series of one or more terms at least one of which is not optional
  or <_anything> can now be optional.

* New built-ins, If and When.

* Bug fix for list entries containing \'s with actions (produced invalid
  Python code).

* Bug fix for adjacent <_anything>'s in command sequences


New in 2.8:

* The Vocola 2 compiler has been ported from Perl to Python, mostly line
  by line except for the parser.

! The parser has been replaced with a new one that produces better error
  messages, describing what was found versus what was expected and
  visually pointing to the error.

* Non-backward compatible parsing changes: 
  * unquoted words may no longer end with ':' if they are not followed
    by whitespace.
  * whitespace may no longer be omitted between variables (e.g.,
    <list><list>); the fact that this ever worked was a bug.

* Some new command line arguments are available for the compiler; see
  the comments at the start of vcl2py.py for details.

* Fixed a bug whereby "load [global] commands" loaded only the first
  relevant command file.

* Versions of Python earlier than 2.5 are no longer supported.
