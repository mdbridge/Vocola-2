New in 2.9:

! Vocola lists may now contain lists; for example,
    <outer> := ( <inner> | just <l>=$1 | 1..20 );
  Those lists (e.g., <inner>) can in turn refer to other lists and so
  on.

* Lists may not be defined recursively; for example, the following is
  not allowed:
    <loop> := loop [<loop>];

! List entries containing lists may refer to those lists in the usual
  way in any definitions of those entries; for example,
    type (0..20 | minus 1..20 = -$1) = $1{tab};
  Here the first $1 in the subcommand "minus 1..20 = -$1" refers to the
  value of the "1..20" list.  Thus "go up minus 3" will result in
  sending the keys "-3{tab}".

* List entries containing a variable or inline list plus one or more
  other terms require an action assignment to tell Vocola how to combine
  the inputs; for example,
    <motion> := <direction> 1..10 = {$1_$2};
  This is a simple but conservative restriction that should be unlikely
  to kick in.  If needed, it will be loosened.

* For clarity, runtime errors while executing an alternative in a list
  now complain about that alternative rather than the the overall
  command.  For example in the following,
    test <thing> = $1;
    <thing> := divide badly = Eval(0/0);
  Vocola will complain about "divide badly" rather than "test <thing>".

* You may now use <_anything> as a command by itself; for example,
    <_anything> = "You said '$1'!";
  This will generally capture any dictation not caught by a more
  specific command.

! Fixed bug where title-specific commands could prevent
  non-title-specific commands of the same grammar from working.


* Vocola now has optional verbose debugging output for recognizing and
  executing commands.  This can be helpful for figuring out which
  command from where is being recognized, with which words, and what
  steps are taken to execute it.  How long executing a command takes can
  also be printed.  Initial verbosity level is zero (no output), but the
  level can be changed using the Vocola extension.

* Optional parts of a command are no longer handled by creating versions
  of the command with and without the optional part.  Instead, the
  generated grammar now directly encodes the optionality without
  duplication; this should reduce grammar complexity.  For complicated
  sets of grammars, this can reduce the delay when switching windows by
  up to 6 times.

* Grammar rules for unused lists are no longer emitted; this means there
  is no runtime overhead for including lists that you don't end up
  using.


! Vocola code generation has been rewritten to first produce a
  backend-agnostic Internal Instruction Language (IIL), which a backend
  then translates into a Python file that uses new runtime libraries to
  implement the needed functionality.

  This should make it much easier to re-target Vocola and improve the
  runtime functionality.

* The runtime for NatLink now independently parses the words that come
  back from Dragon; this allows using much more flexible grammars (e.g.,
  lists containing lists).

* There are currently two backends, one targeting NatLink directly and
  one targeting Dragonfly on NatLink.  Vocola is set up to use the first
  backend out-of-the-box.  The second backend has not been fully tested
  yet and is known to have some limitations mostly due to Dragonfly
  issues.  Known limitations when using dragonfly2==1.0.0-rc2 include:
    * All Vocola commands are implemented as Dragon application-specific
      commands
      * This means Vocola global commands are effectively
        application-specific in terms of priority
        * See https://vocola.net/v2/AmbiguousUtterances for more on
          command priorities
      * This also means that all global Vocola commands are unloaded
        every time you switch windows
        * This can substantially slow down recognition of commands when
          you switch windows when you are using complicated grammars
        * By contrast, with the non-Dragonfly backend, global command
          grammars are never unloaded unless modified
    * Combining <_anything> with other lists in a single command can
      produce command parsing failures
    * Commands containing "a" fail to be recognized
