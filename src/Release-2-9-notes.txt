New in 2.9:

! Vocola lists may now contain lists; for example,
    <outer> := ( <inner> | just <l> | 1..20 );
  Those lists (e.g., <inner>) can in turn refer to other lists and so
  on.

> Recursive loops are not allowed.

! List entries containing lists may refer to those lists in the usual
  way in any definitions of those entries; for example,
    type (0..20 | minus 1..20 = -$1) = $1{tab};
  Here the first $1 in the subcommand "minus 1..20 = -$1" refers to the
  value of the "1..20" list.  Thus "go up minus 3" will result in
  sending the keys "-3{tab}".

* Optional parts of a command are no longer handled by creating versions
  of the command with and without the optional part.  Instead, the
  generated grammar now directly encodes the optionality without
  duplication; this should reduce grammar complexity.  For complicated
  sets of grammars, this can reduce the delay when switching windows by
  up to 6 times.

! Fixed bug where title-specific commands could prevent
  non-title-specific commands of the same grammar from working.


?* Attempting to use <_anything> as a command by itself now prints an
  error rather than crashing the compiler.

?* format_words...



! Vocola code generation has been rewritten to first produce a
  backend-agnostic Internal instruction language (IIL), which a backend
  then translates into a Python file that uses new runtime libraries to
  implement the needed functionality.

  This should make it much easier to re-target Vocola and improve the
  runtime functionality.

* The runtime for NatLink now independently parses the words that come
  back from Dragon; this allows using much more flexible grammars (e.g.,
  lists containing lists).

* There are currently two backends, one targeting NatLink directly and
  one targeting Dragonfly on NatLink.  Vocola is set up to use the first
  backend out-of-the-box.  The second backend has not been fully tested
  yet and is known to have some limitations currently due to Dragonfly
  issues (Dragonfly doesn't support multiple grammar priorities and has
  issues with recognizing non-ASCII words).

* stages...

* error output listing which subcommand

* ability to turn on verbose output for runtime
  * dynamically changeable verbose level
  * print out timing...

* Python 3 support

* pretty print output?


* testing
