<h3>Direct Loading and Discarding</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's useful to reload or discard your command files
  explicitly. For example, if you modify an <a
  href="IncludeStatements.html">include file</a>, Vocola doesn't know
  enough to reload all command files that use that include file.
  Likewise, if you delete or rename a command file, the old commands
  from that file will remain until explicitly discarded or Vocola
  restarts.  You can do loading and discarding yourself using the
  following commands:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"  bordercolor="#FFEECC">
  <tr  bgcolor="#FFEECC"> 
    <td><font color="#660000">When you say</font></td>
    <td><font color="#660000">Vocola will</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>"Load All [Voice] Commands" </td>
      <td>Reload all commands you have defined.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc">
      <td>"Load [Voice] Commands"<strong> </strong></td>
      <td>Reload commands for the currently running application.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>"Load Global [Voice] Commands"<strong> </strong></td>
      <td>Reload global commands.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr bgcolor="#ffffcc"> 
      <td>"Discard Old [Voice] Commands" </td>
      <td>Discard all old commands by discarding all loaded commands
          then reloading all commands you have defined.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
